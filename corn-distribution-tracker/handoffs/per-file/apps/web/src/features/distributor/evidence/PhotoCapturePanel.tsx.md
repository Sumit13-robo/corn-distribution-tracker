# File Handoff: `apps/web/src/features/distributor/evidence/PhotoCapturePanel.tsx`

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Primary owner:** Frontend
**File purpose:** Photo capture UI

## Responsibility
Support fresh camera capture where available, deliberate alternate upload when permitted, preview/retake, size/type checks and clear source label. Avoid persistent public links.

## Contract and dependencies
camera/geolocation helpers

Read the relevant contract in `architecture/` or `design/` before implementing. Preserve the APIs, enum values, permission rules, quantity semantics and state transitions established in those documents. Do not create a parallel implementation of the same domain rule in another layer.

## Implementation requirements
- Implement the file fully; do not leave placeholder bodies for required behavior.
- Keep concerns local to this module and expose a narrow, typed interface to dependent modules.
- Validate untrusted input at the appropriate boundary and return/report useful safe errors.
- Consider authorization scope, concurrency, duplicate requests, accessibility and recoverable failure states where applicable.
- Add or update adjacent tests for important success and failure cases.
- Do not use production personal data, real credentials, real geotagged images or hardcoded demo metrics.

## Acceptance criteria
- Mobile capture and permission denial paths tested.
- The file builds and is integrated with its stated dependencies.
- The behavior matches the source-of-truth docs and is covered by tests where the behavior is non-trivial.

## Handoff back to integrator
When done, report: exported interfaces/endpoints; other files changed; test commands and actual results; environment/config requirements; known limitations; and whether the `file_map.md` status should move to `IMPLEMENTED` or `TESTED`. Only mark `TESTED` when tests were actually run and passed.

## Implementation summary

Camera/file inputs with type/10 MB validation, IndexedDB-backed attach/remove, object-URL previews (revoked correctly) and an offline notice.

**Verification (2026-10-23):** `cd apps/web && npm test` → 39 passed (7 files); `npm run lint` → 0 errors/0 warnings; `npm run build` → tsc + Vite production build succeeded.

**Unresolved issues:** None known.

## 2026-10-26 audit remediation

Removed the false encrypted-at-rest claim for locally queued photos; copy now states local drafts are plaintext browser data.

Verification for the current tree: 98 API tests, 39 web tests, 9 Playwright E2E tests, Ruff/mypy/migration/build gates clean. External provider/container/proxy evidence remains operator-owned.
